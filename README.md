# Campshare

## Overview:
Created by campers for campers! We wanted to address a problem - it is very difficult to reserve campsites at popular National Parks. We created a tool to help users identify National Park Camp Sites within California and reserve or share their reservations with fellow campers. If you have a site to share you can create an account and post the details. Users seraching for a site can creat an account and find what is available and contact the Sharer. It allows users to post items that they are bringing during a time period and make an additional comment for their visit.

## Process
It all starts with the person sharing their site. This is where we collect all of our listings data from. A 'Sharer' logs  in and and fills out a simple form :

![login form] (/assets/images/form.png)

This is then stored in a real-time data base (Firebase).

The next step is for someone who wants to find a site. They will need to login and navigate to the find page where they can select the National Park they want and then they will see the available sites. A card is shown with the share details and with an option to contact the sharer.
