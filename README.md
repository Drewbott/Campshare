# Campshare

## Overview
Created by campers for campers! We wanted to address a problem - it is very difficult to reserve campsites at popular National Parks. We created a tool to help users identify National Park Camp Sites within California and share their reservations with fellow campers. If you have a campsite to share you can create an account and post the details. Users searching for a site can then create an account and find availablity and contact the Sharer.

## Process
It all starts with the user sharing their site. This is where we collect all of our listings data from. A 'Sharer' logs in and fills out a simple form :

![login form](./assets/images/form.png)

This is then stored in a real-time data base (Firebase).

The next step is for someone who wants to find a site. They will need to login and navigate to the find page where they can select the National Park they want and then they will see the available sites. A card is displayed with the share details and a function to contact the sharer.
